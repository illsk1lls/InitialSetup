# InitialSetup.cmd and InitialSetupB.cmd

This is an example CMD script that can be adapted to suit your needs. 

It is possible to run this CMD script from a USB and remove the USB while it is running, when launched it copies itself into %ProgramData% and runs that, when completed it deletes its temporary version. The file you actually click runs for only a second or so and closes, so you won't get stuck on a slow workstation or have to copy the script every time before you use it.

This template can be run on new machines to adjust some commonly changed settings quickly. 

Business and Non-Business example sections are present.

Pretty basic but saves a bunch of time.
